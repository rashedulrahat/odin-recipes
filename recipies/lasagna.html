<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich fillings such as a meat sauce (ragù), béchamel or ricotta sauce, and various cheeses (mozzarella and Parmesan), which is then baked</p>
<p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly!</p>
<h2>Key Ingredients:</h2>
<p>While variations exist, a classic lasagna typically includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Traditional boiled or oven-ready sheets.</li>
  <li><strong>Meat sauce (Ragù)</strong>: A hearty sauce made with ground beef and/or Italian sausage, onions, garlic, and tomatoes (crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste).</li>
  <li><strong>Cheese mixture</strong>: A blend of ricotta (or sometimes cottage cheese), beaten egg (as a binder), Parmesan, and parsley.</li>
  <li><strong>Béchamel (white sauce)</strong>: A traditional creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, often used in authentic Italian recipes.</li>
  <li><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong>: Shredded or sliced for the bubbling, golden-brown topping and layers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Sauces:</strong> First, simmer the meat sauce for at least 30 minutes (longer for a richer flavor) to allow the ingredients to meld. If using, prepare the béchamel sauce separately by making a roux and gradually whisking in the milk until thickened.</li>

  <li><strong>Cook Noodles:</strong> Boil traditional lasagna noodles to al dente according to package directions. Drain them and lay them flat on parchment paper or kitchen towels to prevent sticking.</li>

  <li><strong>Mix the Cheese Filling:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten egg, some of the Parmesan cheese, and any desired herbs or seasonings (like parsley, salt, and pepper).</li>

  <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>Add a layer of lasagna noodles, slightly overlapping if needed.</li>
      <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
      <li>Spoon a layer of meat sauce on top of the ricotta.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, meat sauce, cheeses) until all ingredients are used, ending with noodles topped with sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the dish with aluminum foil (sprayed with nonstick spray to prevent sticking) and bake for 25-45 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 10-25 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>

  <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing to help the layers set.</li>
</ol>
